What Makes Excite Different?
------------------------------------------------------

Forget the old rules. Excite is:

- Lightning fast: Installs in days, not months.
- Truly modular: Only pay for what you use, lease or own, swap modules as needs change.
- Redeployable: Excite isn’t locked to a single site—move it from one job to the next.
- Digital-first: Integrated compliance, QA, and reporting with zero added effort.
- Futureproof and finance-flexible: Innovative leasing and revenue-share programs open access to all operators—regardless of site size or location.

How does it work? Watch this space for reveal.
